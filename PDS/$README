Hi,

The collection of Rexx Execs you will find here in one way or other
comprises :
1. My interest in graphic escape character set and execs as a sequel.
2. Comment/uncomment suite for jcl, cobol, sql and rexx. Edit macros.
3. Focus, MQ, SQL RC - error text retrievers.
4. CA-elips invocation. We had Librarian in one of the shops.
5. Various utilities for ispf. Productivity-enablers.
6. DB2 utilties. Imagecopy, Copypend, Utils and RUNSQL as edit macro.
7. Quick cursor-sensitive suite.
8. Useful utilities gathered in time.

See $INDEX for a comprehensive list.

Hope this helps,
Kannan AK.
